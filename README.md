# FastAPI CRUD operations with JWT Authentication

## Introduction

This project demonstrates how to create a simple web API using the FastAPI framework to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations with JWT (JSON Web Token) authentication. It provides endpoints to manage a todo list, including creating, reading, updating, and deleting todo items securely with JWT authentication.

## Getting Started

To run this project on your system with JWT authentication, follow these steps:

1. **Installation Process**: First, make sure you have Python installed. You can install the required packages using pip.

2. **Software Dependencies**: This project relies on the following Python libraries:
   - FastAPI: A modern, fast web framework for building APIs.
   - SQLAlchemy: A powerful and flexible ORM for working with databases.
   - Uvicorn: An ASGI server to run the FastAPI application.
   - Pydantic: For data validation and serialization.
   - PyJWT: For JWT authentication.

3. **Latest Releases**: The latest releases and updates can be found on the project's GitHub repository:

4. **API References**: You can find API documentation and usage examples in the code or by exploring the project's OpenAPI documentation. To start the API with JWT authentication, run the following command:

# JWT Authentication

To implement JWT authentication in this project, you'll need to follow these steps:

1. **User Registration and Login**: Create endpoints for user registration and login. During registration, store user credentials securely. During login, verify user credentials and generate a JWT.

2. **JWT Generation**: When a user successfully logs in, generate a JWT containing user information and a secret key.

3. **JWT Verification**: Protect your CRUD endpoints by adding JWT verification middleware. Only authorized users with a valid JWT should be able to access these endpoints.

4. **Token Refresh**: Implement token refresh functionality to ensure that tokens have a limited lifespan. Users should be able to obtain a new token without re-entering credentials.

5. **Authorization**: Implement role-based or permission-based authorization to control what users can do within the API.
